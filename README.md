# QGSS22
Lab 1: Intro to circuit composition and cost
<>Introduction to simple one-qubit, multi-qubit gates and creating entangled states
<>Applying Quantum Fourier transform.
<>Optimizing generated entangled states using complexity theory and keeping cost in mind.

Lab 2: Advanced Circuits
<>Using Qiskit Opflow to bridge theoretical ideas and experiment implementation.
<>Example to implement was simulation of the time-evolution of quantum system.

Lab 3: Quantum Noise
<>Quantum Noise which corrupts quantum computation -projection noise, measurement noise, coherent noise and incoherent noise.
<>Techniques we can use to fight the noise and recover the results.

Lab 4:  Simulate a Quantum Spin-½ Model 
<>Use of quantum spin model in mapping optimization problems and quantum system such as molecules or engineered materials.
<>Simulating 𝑋𝑋𝑋 Heisenberg spin model.
