# QGSS22
Lab 1: Intro to circuit composition and cost

  <>Introduction to simple one-qubit, multi-qubit gates and creating entangled states.

  <>Applying Quantum Fourier transform.

  <>Optimizing generated entangled states using complexity theory and keeping cost in mind.


Lab 2: Advanced Circuits

  <>Using Qiskit Opflow to bridge theoretical ideas and experiment implementation.

  <>Example to implement was simulation of the time-evolution of quantum system.


Lab 3: Quantum Noise

  <>Quantum Noise which corrupts quantum computation -projection noise, measurement noise, coherent noise and incoherent noise.

  <>Techniques we can use to fight the noise and recover the results.


Lab 4:  Simulate a Quantum Spin-½ Model 

  <>Use of quantum spin model in mapping optimization problems and quantum system such as molecules or engineered materials.

  <>Simulating 𝑋𝑋𝑋 Heisenberg spin model.
